# Utility elicitation: Participatory Budgeting use case scenario

## Feedback Page

Here is a short video of the feedback page I developed for the project to show the results of participatory budgeting by Chicago ward. The prototype allows the user to compare the results between two wards at a time:

## Notes
If this is the first time running the development environment run `yarn` from the terminal to install the dependencies. If you do not have this command, see the [docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/) for installation instructions. If you do not have node install, you should install it.

Next you are ready to run the development environment. This will start up a development server which you can use to navigate to the application. Keep this process running and builds will be triggered whenever you make a change. 


``sh
npx netlify dev
``

Point yourself to the page, eg http://localhost:8888/

And you're off


If you need to do database stuff, make sure you have mongodb installed and its running (eg run `mongod` in the terminal). It can also help connect to mongo compass.
